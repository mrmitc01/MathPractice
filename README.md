MathPractice

This code is used to implement a program that can be used as a math tutor for Second Grade students 
in an elementary school. The program repeatedly displays a menu to allow the student to select an 
addition, a subtraction, a multiplication, or a division question to solve, until the student chooses 
option 5 to quit the program.

The purposes of each of the following files are stated below:


MathOperations.cpp - to provide the implementation of the member functions of the class named MathOperations

MathOperations.h - to provide the declaration of the class named MathOperations

MathReport.cpp - to provide the implementation of the member functions of the class named MathReport

MathReport.h - to provide the declaration of the class named MathReport

MathTutor.cpp - to implement a math tutor for Second Grade students in an elementary school


Compile the source code by typing the following at the prompt $:
